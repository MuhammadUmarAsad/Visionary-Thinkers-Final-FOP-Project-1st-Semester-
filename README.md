### Installation:
We have used python version **3.9.0**
Click on the link below to install `Python` with `Python IDLE` on your system to run the files

Install python by following link

**https://www.python.org/downloads/**

or click this :
[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   

We have used the following libraries of python in our project:

```
1. pygame
2. TKinter
3. pillow
4. messagebox
5. random
6. functools
7. sys
8. math module
```

you can install these libraries by typing the following command in the cmd
prompt :

```
1. pip install pillow
2. pip install pygame
```

All other libraries are already present while you install the python.In
the program they are already imported.
### Operating instructions:
All the **`graphic files`** used in the platform are already attached in the the **`VISIONARY THINKERS FINAL PROJECT FOP`**
folder.Just download it and launch the program by opening the **`RUN.py`** file.
Use Python editor to open the file and run it.your program will be started and you shall have access to the project files.

### Copyright information:
All the music and graphic files are free.
This is a university symester project. It is open source and freeware file.
You don't need any liscense to purchase and play.It is available for every
person.
Anyone can have access to the files by downloading the folder "MINI-GAME-PLATFORM". This
program is exclusively made by 'Visionary Thinkers'.

### Known bugs:

There are no known bugs in the program.
There may be an error due to wrong
installation of libraries and Python Version.
Make sure you are on atleast version **`3.9.0`**


### Troubleshooting:
Check if the proper version of python i.e. python 3 is installed and all
the proper libraries are installed in the system and are updated according
to the latest version to
avoid any type of inconvinece and all the resources provided in the zip
file are properly installed and are not corrupted.
If you are using
Pycharm,and face some difficulties try to switch on **IDLE** or **some other
compiler** and it will hopefully run fine.

### Features:
The platform is made completly in python and does not use any other
programming language.Other salient features are given in the game document.
